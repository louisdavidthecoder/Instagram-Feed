            The dog you are seeing was built in a lab throught the modern techniques of genetic editing and animal cloning. It's name is goldilocks because it was named after a string of sheep hair. Programmer Louis David recently won a nobel prize 
            for his ability of using javascript react.js to program the software used in the Chinese cloning laboratory. During his speech he said, i want to thank 4geeksacademy for teaching to code. <strong>#4geeksforever</strong>
